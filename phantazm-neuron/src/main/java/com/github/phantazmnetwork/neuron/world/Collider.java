/**
 * <p>Responsible for performing basic collision checks. Most methods operate on axis-aligned bounding boxes (two double
 * triplets representing a rectangular region in 3D space).</p>
 *
 * <p>Those familiar with Bukkit and its implementation of bounding boxes should note that this class expects a slightly
 * different format. While Bukkit bounding boxes are represented by two vectors (one for each opposing corner of the
 * AABB), this class uses what is henceforth referred to as the <i>origin-vector</i> form. In origin-vector form, the
 * first vector (the "origin") represents one corner of the bounding box, and the second vector represents an offset â€”
 * a vector added to the origin to obtain the opposite corner from the first corner. Therefore, the lengths of each edge
 * of the AABB are represented by the absolute value of the corresponding components of the second vector.</p>
